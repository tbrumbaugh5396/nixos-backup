# nixos-backup

Currently, I am running NixOS.
I am interested in understanding exactly all of the different things I am running.

# Desktop Environment
The desktop environment I am currently running is services.xserver.desktopManager.xfce.enable = true;
This is xfce.
This program runs the desktop GUI experience.
The desktop is also responsable for the Hotkeys that are available.

# View which key
In linux, you can run the showkey command.

# Hotkeys
The hotkeys for xfce are available by going to the following tabs: [Applications] >> [Settings] >> [Keyboard] >> [Application Shortcuts]
I have added the shortcut to get to this page: Ctrl + K

# Macros


# Cool Tools for Shortcuts, Hotkeys, Macros, and Recording Tools
You can bind hotkeys to scripts.
Create GUI buttons to make what you are doing easier.
Use recording tools to recreate exactly what you've been doing.
